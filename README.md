<<<<<<< HEAD

by: Ramin Vakili 2017

Overview:
A project to a assemble DNA sequences from a set of short fragments of that DNA sequences (Reads) using Euler tour of the De Bruijn Graph.

Dependencies:
This project has been developed by NetBeans 8.2 and uses hadoop-2.6.5 for MapReduce Processing so Hadoop installation Jars must be added to the project libraries path. 
First install Hadoop and then add the all the jar files in folders listed below of Hadoop installation path:
